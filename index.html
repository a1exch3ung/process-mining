<h2>AnalystX Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence</h2>

<div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
        <p>The Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence (PHDA CoE) is a place where health and care professionals can find and share knowledge and resources as part of an active community, showcasing real-world examples and applications of the latest developments in AnalystX SQL in collaboration with NHS England's <a href="https://future.nhs.uk/DataAnalytics/">AnalystX programme</a>.</p>
        <p>The pandemic has brought together analysis across ICS partners like never before, demonstrating the value of linked data as well as collaborative analytical projects.
</p><p>To take advantage of this opportunity, ICSs will be bringing together their analytical teams in new ICS intelligence functions, whose aim is to ensure that decisions within an ICS are driven by data.
</p><p>New skills will be needed to ensure that the health and care system in England is world-leading in the way that analytics inform clinical, operational and strategic decisions. These include skills to build population-based models of care and ensure that ICSs have an understanding of the challenges facing their population over the long term.
</p><p>To achieve this, the data, analysis and intelligence service in NHSE/I is proposing setting up a Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence, with the national PHM team. This will support ICS analysts to build the skills needed to design and implement population health analytics to transform services.
</p><p>The Centre of Excellence will provide training that is available to a wide range of local ICS analysts, utilising a number of partnerships with suppliers. It will build from the AnalystX community, which already has 15,000 members, many of whom are ICS analysts.
</p><p>The conceptual paper for this section is available here.</p></div>

<h2>Join the team!</h2>
<p>
 We are working with different strategic partners to bring learning modules for our community members.</p>

<p>We were particularly looking for <b>Strategic partners</b>, <b>trainers</b>, <b>mentors</b>, and <b>skill development organisations</b> who want to get involved. If you would liek to be involved please get in touch.</p>

<h2>Level of learning</h2>
<div class="nhsuk-card">
  <div class="nhsuk-card__content">
    <h3 class="nhsuk-card__heading">The Green Level</h3>
    <p class="nhsuk-card__description"><ul>
      <li>
        is the starting point for all things related to data and analytics for population health. Strategic partners are encouraged to begin showcasing their medley of educational offerings and packaging them appropriately. This could include sign-posting to existing educational offerings or even offering bespoke training to ICS analysts. The green level is all about sharing and levelling up the community and so has a neutral cost value attached to it. Please click here to access the latest offerings we have for the green level.

        When thinking of what are the key learning objectives for population health analytics, we would recommend reviewing the DDaT job families by clicking here.
      </li>
      <li>
		We will begin to offer a learning exchange for machine learning resources via the newly created machine learning community of practice. The offering to analysts within integrated care systems will be a directory of population health data science courses. There is already a flurry of activity in flight by way of competitions, hackathons, advocacy, etc.
      </li>
      <li>
        Some current examples of offers made to the ICS analysts include:
		 Segmentation methods through the creation of segmentation champions delivered by Muir Gray
