<h2>Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence</h2>

<div class="nhsuk-grid-row">
    <div class="nhsuk-grid-column-two-thirds">
        <p>The aim of the Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence (PHDA CoE) is to develop a population health data and analytics workforce, and its leaders, with the practical and innovative skills that enable effective decision-making and enable systems to address the needs of their population and transform services.</p><p>To take advantage of this opportunity, ICSs will be bringing together their analytical teams in new ICS intelligence functions, whose aim is to ensure that decisions within an ICS are driven by data.
</p><p>The community will be a space of support, knowledge sharing and development and enable practical application of learning into the real world and everyday work to enact positive change.</p><p>To achieve this, the data, analysis and intelligence service in NHSE/I is proposing setting up a Population Health Data and Analytics Centre of Excellence, with the national PHM team. This will support ICS analysts to build the skills needed to design and implement population health analytics to transform services.
</p><p>The Centre of Excellence will provide training that is available to a wide range of local ICS analysts, utilising a number of partnerships with suppliers. It will build from the AnalystX community, which already has 15,000 members, many of whom are ICS analysts.
</p><p>The conceptual paper for this section is available here.</p></div>

<h2>Join the team!</h2>
<p>
 We are working with different strategic partners to bring learning modules for our community members.</p>

<p>We were particularly looking for <b>Strategic partners</b>, <b>trainers</b>, <b>mentors</b>, and <b>skill development organisations</b> who want to get involved. If you would liek to be involved please get in touch.</p>

		</li>
      <li>
		We will begin to offer a learning exchange for machine learning resources via the newly created machine learning community of practice. The offering to analysts within integrated care systems will be a directory of population health data science courses. There is already a flurry of activity in flight by way of competitions, hackathons, advocacy, etc.

        Some current examples of offers made to the ICS analysts include:
		 Segmentation methods through the creation of segmentation champions delivered by Muir Gray
